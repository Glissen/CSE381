Dear TA,

The project and code for hw3 is in the 'hw3' folder. 

If find the difficulty of our game to be too hard for whatever reason, you may try the following:

1. Remove '&& Ball' from line 104 in 'MyProjectCharacter.cpp' to enable infinite ammo.
2. Comment out lines 85 to 89 in 'MyProjectWolfie.cpp' to prevent the Wolfie guards from shooting at you.

> Note: if you manage to hit the true wolfie or you get hit, the game will freeze meaning the game has ended.

Have fun testing!
